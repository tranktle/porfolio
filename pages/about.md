My name is Tran Le, a Ph.D. candidate from the Department of Data Science at [UMMC](https://www.umc.edu/SoPH/Departments-and-Faculty/Data-Science/Department-of-Data-Science-Home.html).

I obtained my Master's degree from the [Department of Mathematics, Syracuse University](https://thecollege.syr.edu/mathematics/), in May 2019. Overthere, I had a chance to take many mathematics and statistical courses such as [Measure theory](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/principles-of-mathematical-analysis), [Abstract Algebra](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/abstract-algebra), [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://books.google.com/books/about/Numerical_Linear_Algebra.html?id=JaPtxOytY7kC), [Statistical Simulation](https://www.amazon.com/Simulation-Sheldon-M-Ross/dp/0124158250/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=0124158250&psc=1), and [Multivariate Statistical Analysis](https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Multivariate_Statisti.html?id=Cmm9QgAACAAJ), and many more. Afterward, I decided to join the Department of Data Science at UMMC in the fall of 2019 because I want to apply my mathematics and statistics background in Data Science for medical and population health applications.

The courses I have taken at UMMC focus on Bio-Statistics, Data Science, and Programing. I have learned SAS, STATA, R, Python, and SQL. My main interest is using R or Python with Machine Learning and Deep learning methods.

I am currently working on a project using Machine Learning with [h2o.ai](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/index.html) to identify novel factors and interactions associated with dementia: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ARIC Study. The data description can be found [here](https://mindset.umc.edu/aricvarexplorer/index.html). 

Other projects related to using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (CNN, BayesianCNN) may be found in my [GitHub posts](https://tranktle.github.io/porfolio/).
