My name is Tran Le, a PhD student from Department of Data Science from [UMMC](https://www.umc.edu/SoPH/Departments-and-Faculty/Data-Science/Department-of-Data-Science-Home.html).
 
I obtained my Master degree from the [Department of Mathematics, Syracuse University](https://thecollege.syr.edu/mathematics/) in May 2019. I have had chances to take many mathematics and also statistical courses such as [Measure theory](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/principles-of-mathematical-analysis), [Abstract Algebra](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/abstract-algebra), [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://books.google.com/books/about/Numerical_Linear_Algebra.html?id=JaPtxOytY7kC), [Statistical Simulation](https://www.amazon.com/Simulation-Sheldon-M-Ross/dp/0124158250/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=0124158250&psc=1), and [Multivariate Statistical Analysis](https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Multivariate_Statisti.html?id=Cmm9QgAACAAJ)... Afterwards, as I would like to apply mathematics and statistics background in Data Science for medical and population health, I decided to join the Department of Data Science at UMMC in the fall of 2019.

The courses in UMMC that I have taken for the first two years focus on Bio-Statistics and Data Science and Programing. I have learned SAS, STATA, R, Python, HTML, and CSS. My main interest is using R or Python with Machine Learning and Deep learning methods. 

I am currently working on a project using Machine Learning with [h2o.ai](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/index.html) to identify novel factors and interactions associated with dementia: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC](https://sites.cscc.unc.edu/aric/) Study. The data description can be found from [here](https://mindset.umc.edu/aricvarexplorer/index.html). The detailed code and instruction soon will be published.

Other projects related to using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (CNN, BayesianCNN) may be found in my [GitHub posts](https://tranktle.github.io/porfolio/).
