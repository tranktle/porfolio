# Machine Learning

(1)[H2O](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html) is an open source, in-memory, distributed, fast, and scalable machine learning and predictive analytics platform to apply machine learning models on big data. It support R, Python, and Java... users. With R users, instead of installing many packages like rpart, RandomForest, CARET, or e1071..., you only have to install h2o to work with GLM, KMeans, GAM, GBM, SVM, and also AutoML.... You can also use [h2o4GPU](https://www.h2o.ai/blog/h2o-ai-releases-h2o4gpu-the-fastest-collection-of-gpu-algorithms-on-the-market-to-expedite-machine-learning-in-python/) to take advantage of GPUs to build advanced machine learning models. 

(2)[The Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/): a comprehensive and rigorous book for Machine Learning. This book is more mathematically intensive than other books. You may need some mathematics background (linear algebra, statistical theory, probability theory). If you are more interested in applying Machine Learning without working too much with maths, you can try (3)[An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R by Gareth M. James, Trevor Hastie, Daniela Witten, Robert Tibshirani](https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/code.html). After working with (3), you can move to use H2O. 

# R books

[R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This book show you how to use R to work with your data from import, tidy to explore (tranform, visualize, ...) your data. [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) are the two most important pacakges that you can learn how to use from this book

[Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). A more advanced book than R for Data Science to learn R.
