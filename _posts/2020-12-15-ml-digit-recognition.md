# Goal of the project

- Applying and comparing the results of K-nearest-neighbors, Classification-Tree, Random Forest, Support vector machine and Neural Network with a Hand Digit classification problem. 

- All of the above methods will be applied to original data and dimention-reducted data gotton by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
