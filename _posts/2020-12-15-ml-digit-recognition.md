This project is about applying common Machine Learning models to a Hand digit classification problem with/without dimension reduction using PCA

# Goal of the project

- Applying and comparing the results of K-nearest-neighbors, Classification-Tree, Random Forest, Support vector machine and Neural Network with a Hand Digit classification problem. 

- All of the above methods will be applied to original data and dimention-reducted data gotton by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

# Convolution Neural Networks with the MINIST data
After finishing the Project that applied basic Machine Learning to the data. I had move to learn Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Bayesian Convolution Neural Networks (BCNN) from the book [Probabilistic Deep Learning](https://tensorchiefs.github.io/dl_book/). I have learned that applying the CNN can help getting 97% accuracy on the test set. Here is the [link to the jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tranktle/porfolio/blob/master/jupyternotebook/MNIST%20data%20using%20fcNN%20and%20CNN.ipynb)
