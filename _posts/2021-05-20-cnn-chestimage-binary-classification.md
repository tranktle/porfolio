# Applying Convolution Neural Network to a binary classification problem

This is the final project for my Data Science class. 
- Here is the [link of the problem from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Here is the [link to my presenation file](https://github.com/tranktle/porfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CNN_ChestImage.pdf)
- Here is the [link to jupyter notebook file](https://github.com/tranktle/porfolio/blob/master/jupyternotebook/Final_ChestImage.ipynb)
- Here is the [link to CNN_tuning jupyter_notebook](https://github.com/tranktle/porfolio/blob/master/jupyternotebook/Tune_ChestImage.ipynb)

Overall, my accuracy is arround 90%
