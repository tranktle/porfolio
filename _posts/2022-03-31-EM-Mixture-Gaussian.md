# Goal of the project
The purpose of this project is to discover the Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, 
and explore how the EM algorithm works with the Gaussian mixture models and Factor Analysis models.
The project will introduce the EM algorithm and explore how EM clustering algorithm works for:
  - Mixture of two Gaussian distributions in 1D,
  - Mixture of $k>2$ Gaussian distributions in 1D,
  - Mixture of $k>=2$ Gaussian distribution in dimension $d\geq 2$. 

Those will be presented with detailed construction of the E and M step, pseudo-code, and R-code examples.
  - Then an introduction to Factor Analysis and how EM algorithm works for Factor analysis will be presented.
